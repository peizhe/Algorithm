	 * The natural states for this problem is the 3 possible transactions : 
	 * 		buy, sell, rest. Here rest means no transaction on that day (aka cooldown).
	 * Then the transaction sequences can end with any of these three states.
	 * For each of them we make an array, buy[n], sell[n] and rest[n].
	 * 
	 * buy[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with buy.
	 * sell[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with sell.
	 * rest[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with rest.
	 * Then we want to deduce the transition functions for buy sell and rest. By definition we have:
	 * 		buy[i]  = max(rest[i - 1] - price, buy[i - 1])
	 * 		sell[i] = max(buy[i - 1] + price, sell[i - 1])
	 * 		rest[i] = max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1], rest[i - 1])
	 * 
	 * Where price is the price of day i. All of these are very straightforward. They simply represents :
	 * (1) We have to `rest` before we `buy` 
	 * (2) we have to `buy` before we `sell`
	 * 
	 * One tricky point is how do you make sure you sell before you buy, since from the equations it seems that [buy, rest, buy] is entirely possible.
	 * Well, the answer lies within the fact that buy[i] <= rest[i] which means rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], rest[i-1]). That made sure [buy, rest, buy] is never occurred.
	 * A further observation is that and rest[i] <= sell[i] is also true therefore
	 * 		rest[i] = sell[i-1]
	 * 
	 * Substitute this in to buy[i] we now have 2 functions instead of 3:
	 * 		buy[i] = max(sell[i-2]-price, buy[i-1])
	 * 		sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])
	 * 
	 * @param prices
	 * @return
